# patchLIM

Modifies the myLIM executable to run code that you write. Useful for modding your experience (themes and other stuff).

This script only supports macOS, but can probably be ported to Windows in 30 minutes most.

## DISCLAIMER

**You** are responsible for the code you inject. The app will be more prone to code injection if you apply this patch. Be warned. I will decline any responsibility.

## Installing

Make sure to open the app and then modify it, because macOS only enforces asar hash checks at first launch. To modify the mods you will need to unpack/pack the asar manually or reinstall myLIM and use the utility again. 

Install Python and then run the sh file.

```sh run.sh```
